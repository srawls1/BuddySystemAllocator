# BuddySystemAllocator
A buddy system memory allocator developed by Devin Carr and me for a project in our intro to operating systems class, originally hosted on Texas A&M's GitHub Enterprise. The main function tests the allocator by calling an implementation of the Ackerman function that allocates memory at the beginning of a call and releases it at the end.
